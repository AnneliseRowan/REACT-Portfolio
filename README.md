# React Portfolio

## About

Created a React Portfolio not only to share projects while applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also to share work with other developers and collaborate on projects. This is a single-page application to view work samples. There is an About section, a Project section, a Contact form, and a link to download a current resume.
